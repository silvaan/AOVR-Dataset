# AOVR-Dataset

## Annotated Objects for Visual Reasoning Dataset

The AOVR-Dataset is a synthetic 3D dataset designed to facilitate research in visual reasoning and object detection. The dataset includes various 3D objects placed in different containers, each annotated with bounding boxes and natural language descriptions. The 3D models were created using Blender, and the captions were generated with a Large Language Model (LLM).
